# WhatsappChatAnalysis
Code to analyze the most spoken words in a WhatsApp chat by each participant

The code requires a whatsapp chat in .txt format, it then cleans the data to determine what are the most spoken words by each participant
(multiple chats work as long as they are in the same .txt file)

Emoji are supported once the emoji tooklit is installed
Works both for chats exported off of Android and Apple with slight modifications, though tested mainly on Android expored chats.

Feel free to message me for any further queries/requests!
